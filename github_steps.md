# GitHub Steps

Describe in your own words how to establish a connection between a local repository and a remote repository on GitHub.

Establishing a connection between a local repo and a remote repo on Github can be accomplished by first forking the repo over to your account. 

After the fork has been completed users will click the green inline button "< > Code". 

Click SSH option 

Copy Clone key (IE "git@github.com:username/example.git")

Open Terminal type "git clone" and paste the clone key you copied over from Github. 

You can double check if the directory was created by using "ls" and you should see it listed as a new directory.

"cd" into the new directory and you can now edit the files needed.
